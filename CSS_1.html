<!-- Paragraph_1 -->
    <p class="hhg">
        Whether you are an application development firm or an application service provider, digital marketing is one of the fields that can benefit you immensely in promotion of your business. In comparison to conventional marketing channels, digital marketing or online marketing comes with a vast range of benefits. Some of them have been mentioned below:
        The cost of marketing your product and services using traditional marketing methods such as newspaper, pamphlets, television etc. are costlier as compared to online advertising. So, if you are looking for a cost-effective means to promote your products or services, then digital marketing would be the best option.
    </p>
    <p class="hhg">
        At low expense, you can cover a wider segment of pollution that is not possible with any other marketing mediums. In just a few dollars, you can easily subscribe your business to an email advertising provider firm and send direct or transactional emails to hundreds of customers present on the mailing list.
        Digital marketing has the potential to provide a considerable return on your small investments. This type of marketing campaigns on social networking platforms cost you a little but gives you huge rewards in the form of ROI in comparison to traditional advertising methods.
    </p>
    <p class="hhg">
        The success of a digital marketing campaign is easy to determine. Unlike conventional marketing methods, wherein you need to wait for a month to evaluate the authenticity of the campaign, digital marketing gives you immediate results to find out whether or not the ad is performing.
        Use of email marketing software enables one to measure the performance of emails. Google Analytics effectively measures specific objectives to be realized on a blog or a website. Google AdWords enables users to evaluate the performance of the advertisements on search engine to find out how many people have viewed their marketing advertisements and also learn about rate of conversion.
